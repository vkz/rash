;; Delete every file in DIR containing the string "bin/sh":
(with-cwd dir
  (for-each (lambda (file)
              (if (zero? (run (grep -s bin/sh ,file)))
                  (delete-file file)))

;; DES encrypt string PLAINTEXT with password KEY. My DES program
;; reads the input from fdes 0, and the key from fdes 3. We want to
;; collect the ciphertext into a string and return that, with error
;; messages going to our stderr. Notice we are redirecting Scheme data
;; structures (the strings PLAINTEXT and KEY) from our program into
;; the DES process, instead of redirecting from files. RUN/STRING is
;; like the RUN form, but it collects the output into a string and
;; returns it (see following section).

;; find all .c files in the current directory
;; collect them in a list of strings

(filter (lambda (fname)
          (eq? 'directory
               (fileinfo:type (file-attributes fname))))
        (directory-files))

;; with helper-functions thrown in becomes as short as
(filter file-directory? (directory-files))

;; First-class procedures also allow iterators such as
;; for-each and filter to loop over lists of data
;; ---------------------------------------------------
;; build the list of all my files in /usr/tmp
(filter (lambda (f) (= (file-owner f) (user-uid)))
        (glob "/usr/tmp/*"))
;; ---------------------------------------------------
;; delete every C file in my directory
(for-each delete-file (glob "*.c"))
